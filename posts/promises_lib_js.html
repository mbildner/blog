  <h2>Promises in JavaScript</h2>

  <h3>Wat are Promises?</h3>
  <p>
    <em>TL;DR Promises are a functional abstraction to manage asynchronous control flow. BOOM.</em>

    Promises are a really cool technique for managing async stuff in your code. The technique gives you a `promise` object that has a method for adding callbacks to be called after some asynchronous code runs. These promises can be chained together, meaning that we can finally flatten out our dreaded <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=callback+hell+javascript">nested callbacks<a> into a clean, understandable chain of calls. Promises help turn this:

    <pre>
      getUserId(function (userId) {
        getUserInfo(userId, function (userInfoObj) {
          saveUserInfo(userInfoObj, function (saveWorked) {
            if (saveWorked) {
              alert('congratulations, your data is saved on the server');
            }
            else {
              alert('oh no! your data got all gatted');
            }
          });
        });
      });
    </pre>
    into this:
    <pre>
      getUserId()
        .then(getUserInfo)
        .then(saveUserInfo)
        .then(function (saveWorked) {
          if (saveWorked) {
            alert('congratulations, your data is saved on the server');
          }
          else {
            alert('oh no! your data got all gatted');
          }
        })
    </pre>



  </p>
  <h3>
    Why do I care?
  </h3>
  <p>
    You care because dealing with async stuff is really really hard, and any tool that makes your code easier to write and - much more importantly - <em>easier to read</em> will make you a better programmer.
