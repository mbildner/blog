	<h1>Blogging about Web Development Without Doing It</h1>

	<p>
		I'm a software engineer by day, and while I love doing web development, I found that trying to build a serious app for my blogging was getting in the way of actually doing any writing. So this is my blog. There will be no fancy styling here. For the most part, this blog will consist of just enough HTML to hold some plain black text on a plain white background.
